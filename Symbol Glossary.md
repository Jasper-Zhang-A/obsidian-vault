## Glossary of Vector Calculus Symbols

* **$\vec{F}$**: A **Vector Field**. A function that assigns a vector to each point in space. For example, $\vec{F} = P\vec{i} + Q\vec{j} + R\vec{k}$.
* **$P, Q, R$**: The **scalar component functions** of a 3D vector field $\vec{F}$.
* **$f$**: A **Scalar Function**. A function that assigns a single number (scalar) to each point in space.
* **$C, L, \partial S$**: A **Curve** or **Path** in space. It is often the boundary of a surface $S$.
* **$S$**: A **Surface** in space. It can be open (like a sheet) or closed (like a sphere).
* **$D$**: A **2D Region** in a plane (e.g., the $xy$-plane), often enclosed by a curve $C$.
* **$V$**: A **3D Solid Region** in space, enclosed by a surface $S$.
* **$\vec{r}(t)$**: The **position vector** that traces out a curve $C$ as the parameter $t$ changes.
* **$d\vec{r}$**: The **differential displacement vector** along a curve $C$. It is a vector pointing in the direction of the tangent, with magnitude $ds$. It is equivalent to $\vec{T}ds$.
* **$ds$**: The **differential arc length element**. It is a scalar representing an infinitesimally small length along a curve.
* **$\vec{T}$**: The **unit tangent vector** to a curve, indicating the direction of the path. $\vec{T} = \frac{d\vec{r}/dt}{|d\vec{r}/dt|}$.
* **$\vec{n}$**: The **unit normal vector**. For a surface, it is a vector of length 1 that is perpendicular to the surface at a given point.
* **$d\sigma$ or $dS$**: The **differential surface area element**. It is a scalar representing an infinitesimally small patch of area on a surface.
* **$d\vec{S}$**: The **differential vector area element**. It is a vector with magnitude $dS$ pointing in the direction of the surface's normal vector $\vec{n}$. $d\vec{S} = \vec{n} dS$.
* **$dV$**: The **differential volume element**. In Cartesian coordinates, $dV = dx\,dy\,dz$.
* **$\nabla$**: The **del operator**. It is the vector differential operator $\nabla = \vec{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \vec{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \vec{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$.
* **$\nabla f$**: The **Gradient** of a scalar function $f$. It is a vector field that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of $f$.
* **$\nabla \cdot \vec{F}$**: The **Divergence** of a vector field $\vec{F}$. It is a scalar that measures the magnitude of a field's source or sink at a given point. Also written as $\text{div}(\vec{F})$.
* **$\nabla \times \vec{F}$**: The **Curl** of a vector field $\vec{F}$. It is a vector that measures the tendency of the field to rotate around a point. Also written as $\text{curl}(\vec{F})$ or $\text{rot}(\vec{F})$.
* **$\oint_C$**: A **Line Integral** over a **closed** curve $C$ (a loop).
* **$\iint_S$**: A **Surface Integral** over a surface $S$. If the surface $S$ is closed, it represents the boundary of a volume.
* **$\iiint_V$**: A **Volume Integral** over a solid region $V$.
