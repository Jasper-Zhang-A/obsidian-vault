Your question about the dimensionality mismatch is excellent and gets to the heart of the matter. You are correct that you cannot form a proper cross product determinant with a 2-component vector. The mathematical method to resolve this is to temporarily "lift" the 2D vector field into 3D space.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1.  **Treat the 2D vector field as a "flat" 3D vector field.**
    Let's say your 2D vector field is $\vec{F}(x,y) = P(x,y)\vec{i} + Q(x,y)\vec{j}$. We can treat this as a 3D vector field whose $z$-component is simply zero:
    $$\vec{F}(x,y,z) = P(x,y)\vec{i} + Q(x,y)\vec{j} + 0\vec{k}$$

2.  **Calculate the curl in 3D using the determinant.**
    Now that we have a standard 3D vector, we can use the familiar 3x3 determinant to compute its curl, $\nabla \times \vec{F}$.
    $$
    \nabla \times \vec{F} = 
    \begin{vmatrix} 
    \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
    P & Q & 0 
    \end{vmatrix}
    $$
    Let's expand this determinant by its components:
    * **i-component**: $(\frac{\partial (0)}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z})$. Since $Q$ does not depend on $z$, $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} = 0$. The result is $0$.
    * **j-component**: $(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial (0)}{\partial x})$. Similarly, $\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = 0$. The result is $0$.
    * **k-component**: $(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y})$. This is the familiar expression!

    The resulting curl vector points purely in the $\vec{k}$ direction:
    $$\nabla \times \vec{F} = 0\vec{i} + 0\vec{j} + \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\vec{k}$$

3.  **Perform the final dot product with $\vec{k}$.**
    The expression in Green's Theorem is $(\nabla \times \vec{F}) \cdot \vec{k}$. Using our result from the previous step:
    $$(\nabla \times \vec{F}) \cdot \vec{k} = \left[ \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\vec{k} \right] \cdot \vec{k}$$
    Since $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{k} = 1$, the final result is the scalar function:
    $$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}$$
    This elegantly connects the 3D curl operator back to the familiar 2D form of Green's Theorem.

### Concrete Example

Let's use the vector field $\vec{F} = (x^2+y^2)\vec{i} - 2xy\vec{j}$. Here, $P = x^2+y^2$ and $Q = -2xy$.

1.  **Lift to 3D:**
    $$\vec{F} = (x^2+y^2)\vec{i} - 2xy\vec{j} + 0\vec{k}$$

2.  **Calculate the Curl $\nabla \times \vec{F}$:**
    $$
    \nabla \times \vec{F} = 
    \begin{vmatrix} 
    \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
    x^2+y^2 & -2xy & 0 
    \end{vmatrix}
    $$
    The $\vec{i}$ and $\vec{j}$ components are zero, as shown in the general case.
    The $\vec{k}$ component is $(\frac{\partial (-2xy)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial (x^2+y^2)}{\partial y}) = (-2y) - (2y) = -4y$.
    
    So, the curl is $\nabla \times \vec{F} = -4y\vec{k}$.

3.  **Perform the dot product:**
    $$(\nabla \times \vec{F}) \cdot \vec{k} = (-4y\vec{k}) \cdot \vec{k} = -4y$$

If we had used the direct 2D formula $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}$, we would get:
$$\frac{\partial (-2xy)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial (x^2+y^2)}{\partial y} = -2y - 2y = -4y$$
The results match perfectly.

### Summary
Your question about the dimension mismatch is a critical one. Mathematicians resolve it by embedding the 2D problem into 3D space. This allows powerful 3D operators like curl to be applied consistently and harmoniously to 2D scenarios, ultimately yielding the standard 2D formulas we use.
